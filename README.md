# HyperAmbient - A HyperTerm theme that responds to ambient light changes

Due to changing lightning conditions using just one color scheme rarely suffices. Especially when moving from indoors to sunny outdoors a dark color scheme that looked incredible is almost unreadable.
Thus the terminal color scheme should react to ambient light!

Let me introduce HyperAmbient - the HyperTerm theme that let's you use color scheme adequate to current ambient light.

Currently underlying implementation for accessing ambient light only works in OSX.

## How install

Install HyperTerm and add hyperambient to plugins in ~/.hyperterm.js.

## How to use

When lightning conditions change, reload plugins so that the color scheme can be changed if necessary.

## TODO

- [ ] Automatically change color scheme when lightning conditions changes
- [ ] Make themes configurable
